# Dots Game

It's one of my first serious python projects, so please be understanding ðŸ˜… and enjoy this simple game ðŸŽ®. Right now most of the code and GUI are in Polish, maybe one day I will try to change it. The game is preaty simple to understande, but hard to master, so I hope you will have grat time playing ðŸ˜‰.

```s
pip install pygame
```

## Start game
